<p><span style="font-size: medium;">While you may pay attention to keeping the interior of your home looking beautiful and fresh, what about the outside? Pavements, driveways and patios have a hard life; not only are they open to the elements but they are subject to heavy use by people ad vehicles, and in time they will naturally begin to look tired and worn. Cleaning can help, but what if there was a company offering affordable, quality paving, in various designs, that could replace your existing paving and patio with a beautiful new one?</span><br />

<p>Why do we recommend Namibia for celebs? Because this beautiful and mysterious country, with its sprawling desert and amazing beaches, is one of the most spectacular of all in Africa, and offers a rare opportunity to see the continent in its most authentic, unspoilt form. From the charming capital of Windhoek, with its fine restaurants, bars and shops, to the majestic sand dunes of the Namib Desert – the tallest in the world – you have a range of diverse and amazing attractions, and there is one place where you can find all the information you need.</p>
<p>Book Namibia is not a tour operator itself, but a comprehensive resource containing all the information and advice you need on travelling to Namibia. They have collected details of the leading tour operators and safari providers, offer information on the best accommodation Namibia, and also where to hire a car or 4&#215;4, the latter being essential if you are to travel in this wonderful country. A safari is a must in Namibia, and there are many established companies offering excellent deals. Also, Book Namibia has information on general travel tips in the country which will help make your life easier.</p>
<p>Namibia is a real slice of Africa, a place where little has changed over the years. You can take an opportunity to visit ancient nomadic tribes who still live as they did centuries ago, and to visit the colourful townships that have been shaped by the different cultural influences across the years. Or, you could simply relax on one of the many fine beaches, where the Atlantic Ocean laps at the glorious sandy shore. You can find advice on all aspects of visiting Namibia here, so check out the Book Namibia website, and find out what are the most popular things to try in Namibia!</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header --><div class="entry-content" itemprop="idBody"><p>Are you thinking of taking a safari holiday on Africa? It is something of a dream for most of us, and these days you can find some very good deals. We can’t help but recommend you consider KwaMbili Game Lodge, a wonderful example of traditional bush <a href="http://www.kwambilisafarilodge.com/accomodation.php" target="_blank">accommodation in Hoedspruit</a> that offers you the chance to enjoy an experience you will never forget. This is a rare opportunity to see the real, unspoilt Africa, a place where you will be as far from your home as you could ever be, and it is a quite magical place to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-29 size-full" src="http://celebrity-exchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kwambili-safari-lodge.jpg" alt="kwambili safari lodge" width="550" height="365" srcset="http://celebrity-exchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kwambili-safari-lodge.jpg 550w, http://celebrity-exchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kwambili-safari-lodge-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />KwaMbili Lodge is located in the Thornybush <a href="http://www.kwambilisafarilodge.com/" target="_blank">Game Reserves in Limpopo</a>, and features a choice of thatched chalets or traditional safari tents. While each has all the facilities you will need for a comfortable stay, you are in the heart of the bush, and many exotic local animals wander freely through the camp and use the nearby water hole, where you can watch them go about their business. What makes this location special is that it is right next to the Kruger National Park, where you stand a chance of viewing the fabled ‘Big Five’, something that can be done in only a few places in Africa.</p>
<p>The lodge is a great place to stay for an experience like no other, and the food – cooked here by local chefs – is spectacular. There is a pool for relaxing in should you need to cool down, a bar where you can find an array of drinks, and what could be more authentic than a campfire at night, when the rangers tell their tales of adventure from across the years? KwaMbili Game Lodge is a unique experience providing stunning accommodation in Hoedspruit, whether for a family or a romantic break for two, so check it out now, you won’t be disappointed.</p>

	</header><!-- .entry-header --><div class="entry-content" itemprop="idBody"><p>Have you reached a point in your life where you are unsure of what happens next? Or, perhaps you feel like you are floundering at work, or in a relationship, and have no idea what to do about it? It happens to us all: we get to a point where we feel that we are not achieving what we could be, or where we can’t see the way forward. After all, we are not taught how to handle life; we are simply expected to go out into the world, and get on with it.</p>
<p>This can – quite naturally – lead to depression and anxiety, and these are problems that can get in the way of our lives. At Integrative Life Coaching, based in Cape Town, you can learn how to overcome these problems that affect us all, in order to see a clear path forward and improve your life. It’s all about unlocking what the founder, <a href="http://www.integrativelifecoaching.co.za/">Warren Munitz</a>, calls the ‘authentic self’, and learning how to control and use the unconscious mind, that part of us that influences far more than we may currently understand.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGbzYS8z3hY?rel=0&amp;controls=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Integrative Life Coaching offers a range of courses (including <a href="http://www.integrativelifecoaching.co.za/coach-training" target="_blank">accredited life coaching courses</a>) that will take you on a journey of self-discovery, where you will learn about yourself in ways you never could have imagined. Many people have already taken advantage of personal coaching, leadership coaching, and much more – including how to handle anxiety and depression – and have learned from Warren, who underwent a lengthy journey of discovery himself, how to overcome the emotional baggage that influences the way we live. If you think this could be of help to you, get in touch with Integrative Life Coaching and learn more about how <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/title/celebrity-life-coach">life coaching</a> can help you.

<p>Are you the owner of a car that you don’t use very often? If so, did you know that there is a way of making money by hiring it out (even to <a href="http://www.posh24.com/celebrities">celebrities</a>)? RentMyRide is an innovative scheme available to residents in South Africa who have a vehicle they use only occasionally, and it really is a way of making some money! How does it work? It’s simple, you register your vehicle with RentMyRide – it’s a simple form that you fill in and submit to them – and they put it on the list of cars to rent.</p>
<p>The RentMyRide concept turns car hire on its head; you hiring out your vehicle to private renters who find your type of car and location convenient – and who appreciate the lower prices – and RentMyRide covers the insurance. You must keep your car maintained to the agreed standard – there is a checklist on the website that tells you everything you need to check – and when someone in your area needs to hire a car, perhaps for a business trip or simply a day out or <a href="https://rentmyride.co.za/" target="_blank">even for monthly car rental</a>, they contact you and it’s all sorted out between you.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the good bit: RentMyRide operates a rating system. Once the renter returns the car to you, you enter a rating as to how they were to deal with. This allows for everyone else to see if they wish to let their cars to them. Furthermore, RentMyRide vets every driver before allowing them to join, and as you – the owner – will meet them when they come to pick it up, you can choose to decline if you wish. It’s a real no-brainer for anyone who has a car standing idle: put it to work and make some money with <a href="https://rentmyride.co.za/car-hire-cape-town" target="_blank">long term car rental Cape Town</a>! Get in touch now for more information or register your car and let’s get going!</p>
