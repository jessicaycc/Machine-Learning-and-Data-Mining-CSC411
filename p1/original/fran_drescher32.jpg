			<h2>5 Ways to Use Petroleum Jelly for Skin Care</h2>
			 
		 	<p><em>You don’t have to buy expensive products to heal skin and make it look great. The solution, according to the experts from the American Academy of Dermatology, is simply petroleum jelly.</em></p>
<p>The skin is the body’s largest organ, so it’s important to take good care of it. However, doing so doesn’t necessarily mean breaking the bank, say dermatologists from the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). In fact, petroleum jelly, a common, inexpensive product found in most people’s medicine cabinets, can have multiple skin care uses for the entire family.</p>
<p>“When it comes to skin care, expensive isn’t always better,” said board-certified dermatologist Rebecca Baxt, MD, FAAD, who maintains a private practice in Paramus, N.J., and New York. “Petroleum jelly, which can be found in just about anyone’s local drugstore, is great for moisturizing rough, cracked feet, elbows and hands, and protecting kids’ scrapes and bumps.”</p>
<p>To save on skin care, Baxt recommends using petroleum jelly to:
<ol>
<li>Relieve dry skin, including lips and eyelids. Dry skin can flake, itch, crack and even bleed. Since ointments are more effective and less irritating than lotions, consider applying petroleum jelly to dry skin, including your lips and eyelids. The skin on your eyelids is the thinnest skin on the body and can get irritated easily. If your eyelids get dry and flaky, carefully apply a small amount of petroleum jelly for moisture and protection. For the best results, always apply petroleum jelly when your skin is damp.</li>
<li>Help injured skin heal. For minor wounds such as cuts, scrapes and scratches, use petroleum jelly to keep the wound moist. This helps prevent the wound from drying out and forming a scab, as scabs take longer to heal. This will also help prevent a scar from getting too large, deep or itchy. As long as the wound is cleaned daily, it is not necessary to use antibacterial ointments.</li>
<li>Prevent chafing. Chafing is a painful skin irritation that occurs when body parts rub together or rub against clothing. To prevent chafing that can lead to blisters, apply petroleum jelly to problem areas, such as the feet or thighs.</li>
<li>Treat diaper rash. The best way to prevent diaper rash is to keep your baby’s skin as dry and clean as possible. However, if your baby does get a rash, apply petroleum jelly during each diaper change. With the right care, your baby’s rash should clear in about three to four days. If the rash doesn’t go away, see a board-certified dermatologist.</li>
<li>Rehydrate nails. If you frequently get manicures and pedicures, apply petroleum jelly to your nails and cuticles in between polishes. This will minimize brittleness and help prevent your nails from chipping. For the best results, apply it when your nails are damp.</li>
</ol>
<p>“While petroleum jelly has many benefits, it shouldn’t be used for everything,” Baxt said. “Avoid putting petroleum jelly on your face if you are acne-prone, as this may cause breakouts in some people. If you have questions about your skin or how to take care of it, see a board-certified dermatologist.”</p>

			<h2>Here&#8217;s How Stress May Be Making You Sick</h2>
			 
		 	<p>A Michigan State University researcher is providing new insight into how certain types of stress interact with immune cells and can regulate how these cells respond to allergens, ultimately causing physical symptoms and disease.</p>
<p>The federally funded study, published in January 2018 in the <em>Journal of Leukocyte Biology</em>, showed how a stress receptor, known as corticotropin-releasing factor, or CRF1, can send signals to certain immune cells, called mast cells, and control how they defend the body.</p>
<p>A release from the university quotes Adam Moeser, an associate professor and endowed chair who specializes in stress-induced diseases, as saying, &#8220;Mast cells become highly activated in response to stressful situations the body may be experiencing. When this happens, CRF1 tells these cells to release chemical substances that can lead to inflammatory and allergic diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, life-threatening food allergies and autoimmune disorders such as lupus.&#8221;</p>
<p>One chemical substance, histamine, is known to help the body get rid of invading allergens such as pollen, dust mites or the protein of a particular food like a peanut or shellfish. The histamine causes an allergic reaction and in a normal response, helps the body clear the allergen from its system.</p>
<p>If a patient has a severe allergy or is under a lot of stress, then this same response can be amplified, resulting in more severe symptoms ranging from trouble breathing, anaphylactic shock or possibly even death.</p>
<p>During the study, Moeser compared the histamine responses of mice to two types of stress conditions &#8211; psychological and allergic &#8211; where the immune system becomes overworked. One group of mice was considered &#8220;normal&#8221; with CRF1 receptors on their mast cells and the other group had cells that lacked CRF1.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the &#8216;normal&#8217; mice exposed to stress exhibited high histamine levels and disease, the mice without CRF1 had low histamine levels, less disease and were protected against both types of stress,&#8221; Moeser said. &#8220;This tells us that CRF1 is critically involved in some diseases initiated by these stressors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CRF1-deficient mice exposed to allergic stress had a 54 percent reduction in disease, while those mice who experienced psychological stress had a 63 percent decrease.</p>
<p>The results could change the way everyday disorders such as asthma and the debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are treated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know that stress affects the mind-body connection and increases the risk for many diseases,&#8221; Moeser said. &#8220;The question is, how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This work is a critical step forward in decoding how stress makes us sick and provides a new target pathway in the mast cell for therapies to improve the quality of life of people suffering from common stress-related diseases.&#8221;</p>

			<h2>12 Tips for Finding Peace in the Midst of Your Brilliantly Messy Life</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Most of us are taught that perfection is what we should strive for, but one of the most surprising treasures I’ve discovered in my life is how my capacity to be in my mess—the good, the bad, the ugly, and everything in between—leads me to more fully embracing my unique genius, as well as my true passion, purpose, and joy! As women, we contain entire worlds of wisdom&#8230;worlds that are as beautiful, profound, and gorgeously complicated as we are. It’s time to own that and use it to our advantage. Here are twelve tips for doing just that!
<ol>
<li>Give up the endless to-do list. Future-tripping can sometimes feel necessary (after all, if we don’t get to it, who will?) but the truth is, it can take us out of our center and numb us to what’s really going on right here and now. Instead, make more space for yourself and prioritize your relationship with yourself over all the stuff in your life that’s clamoring for your attention!</li>
<li>Relish your “me” time. Finding sanctuary is truly an inside job, so today, find some time to unplug from the daily grind by asking what brings you joy and gives you pleasure. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to unwind without any interruptions from the outside world.</li>
<li>Embrace your inner child. That’s the part of you that comes alive in the presence of what delights you. We tend to shrink our capacity for pleasure as we get older, so tap into that childlike wonder and let it be a source of support.</li>
<li>Feel your anger. Anger is not the most comfortable emotion to feel (especially if we’ve been taught to be nice at all costs) but skillfully giving it a voice actually leads us to a deeper sense of self-connection. Today, feel the pure energy of your anger and be open to the lessons it’s trying to teach you.</li>
<li>Ask for support. Connecting to the spirit of our messiness is not something we can hope to do alone—at least not for the long term! So tell someone you love that you need them. Be honest about your limitations, as well as your strengths.</li>
<li>Just say no. Give the people and situations in your life your whole-hearted NO. Practice not offering any additional explanations or reasons, even when it feels edgy. And make sure you do this with no guilt whatsoever!</li>
<li>Just say yes. Notice what lights you up and makes you say yes effortlessly. Notice the places where you want to say yes but you are experiencing fear or hesitation. Just like yesterday, be unabashed and leave your guilt at the door.</li>
<li>Just say you don’t know. A huge part of coming to terms with our own messiness is engaging with everything from a place of open curiosity. Instead of acting like you have everything figured out, give yourself the gift of not knowing—and see what arises from that!</li>
<li>Trust your gut. Today, locate your intuition physically—inside your gut, your heart, or anywhere else where your sense of inner knowing feels strong. Figure out how your intuition speaks to you. How can you practice trusting it even more?</li>
<li>Be willing to have the hard conversations. Practice radical honesty in all your interactions today—and this includes conversations with yourself. Speak what is true every moment of the day—especially when it feels a little scary or edgy. And if you want to take a deep dive into hard conversations, check out Women For One’s popular Hard Conversations Toolkit.</li>
<li>Honor your imperfections. Perfection does not exist! When we aren’t so busy controlling absolutely everything in our lives, our brilliance rises up naturally to the surface and surprises us with its beauty. The world isn’t going to fall apart if you aren’t perfect. If anything, it might end up getting bigger, shinier, and way more interesting.</li>
<li>Forgive yourself. Everything you love about yourself is intrinsically connected to the “mistakes” and missteps along the way. Instead of letting your challenges shut you down or diminish your power, you can just be with what is in your life. Let compassion wash over you. Say, “I forgive myself, for everything.” You may not feel the forgiveness immediately, but I promise that this simple gesture will have ripple effects.</li>

			<h2>Patient Satisfaction Linked to Number of Nurses on Staff</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Hospital patients’ satisfaction with their care drops when the patients believe that staffing levels of nurses are too low, according to a new study conducted by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southampton, UK, and King’s College, London.</p>
<p>The study results were based on the British NHS (National Health Service) Inpatient Survey and were published in the <em>BMJ Open</em>. NHS is the name of the public health service in the UK.</p>
<p>Just 14 per cent of patients who reported there were never or rarely enough nurses on the hospital ward rated their care as excellent, while 57 percent of patients who reported there were usually enough nurses rated their care as excellent.</p>
<p>The study also showed that only 60 per cent of the 66,348 patients responding to the NHS survey reported that there were usually enough nurses available to provide their care. One in 10 patients surveyed said there were never or rarely enough professional nurses during their hospital stay.</p>
<p>The investigators said that the findings indicate that it is the availability of qualified registered nurses in hospitals that most affects patient satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The often repeated narrative suggesting that quality deficits in hospitals are due to &#8216;uncaring&#8217; nurses is not supported by evidence from the NHS&#8217;s own survey,&#8221; said author Linda Aiken, PhD, RN, Director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania. &#8220;Patients value nurses so much that when nurses are in short supply, patients&#8217; overall ratings of their hospitals decline sharply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Peter Griffiths, from the University of Southampton, said: &#8220;The variation in nurse staffing levels between different NHS hospitals is huge. When there aren&#8217;t enough professional nurses, things get missed, patients notice, and this affects their confidence in the quality of the hospital and the care they receive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;England has one of the lowest percentages among European countries of professional nurses at the bedside already. We know that 65 per cent of nurses in hospitals in England say that high workloads prevent them from spending enough time comforting patients, while 52 per cent of nurses say they don&#8217;t have enough time to teach patients and their families how to manage after hospital [stays]. The NHS needs to focus on achieving safe registered nurse staffing levels as a means to achieve better outcomes, including improving patients&#8217; satisfaction with their care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study shows that patients&#8217; confidence in doctors and nurses is equally important in whether they rate the hospital care as excellent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoring up nurse staffing as well as medical staffing is warranted to improve quality of care,&#8221; said Professor Anne Marie Rafferty, DPhil (Oxon) RN, from the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative Care, King&#8217;s College London.</p>
<p>“Patient perception is an important barometer of quality of care and confidence in the NHS. The widening gap between demand and capacity is reflected in missed care, which in turn is associated with poor nurse staffing and poor hospital environments. Improving nurse staffing in NHS hospitals holds promise for improving patient satisfaction.”</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Are Women Really Under-Represented in Clinical Trials?</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Several studies have reported a lack of gender diversity in clinical trials, with trials including mostly adult males; however, a recent review of publicly available registration data of clinical trials at the US Food and Drug Administration for the most frequently prescribed drug classes found no evidence of any systemic significant under-representation of women. The findings were published in January 2018 the <em>British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</em>.</p>
<p>A release from the publisher notes that the analysis entailed 38 drugs with a total inclusion of 185,479 trial participants and revealed that through the clinical development phase, the proportion of women participating in trials gradually increases from 22% in phase 1 to over 48% for phase 2/3 trials.</p>
<p>The release quotes co-author Dr. Robert Rissmann, of the Centre for Human Drug Research, in The Netherlands as saying, &#8220;The results of this investigation show that drug trials are appropriately designed regarding inclusion of men and women. Furthermore, the underrepresentation of women in trials as observed in the 1980s and before seems to be resolved for most drug trials that we investigated. Although some earlier studies had reported an underrepresentation of women, our results are fully in line with recent results of a Cochrane meta-analysis, which underlines the robustness of our findings.&#8221;</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>What Should I Ask My Doctor During My Checkup?</h2>
			 
		 	<p><em>Editor’s note: A visit to the doctor can be an intimidating and at times overwhelming experience, so it might be difficult to remember everything you’d like to ask your physician. Here, the experts from the National Institute on Aging share what questions you should ask, and how to ask them. You might want to read this before your next appointment, or even take a printout with you.</em></p>
<p>Asking questions is key to good communication with your doctor. If you don&#8217;t ask questions, he or she may assume you already know the answer or that you don&#8217;t want more information. Don&#8217;t wait for the doctor to raise a specific question or subject; he or she may not know it&#8217;s important to you. Be proactive. Ask questions when you don&#8217;t know the meaning of a word (like aneurysm, hypertension, or infarct) or when instructions aren&#8217;t clear (for example, does taking medicine with food mean before, during, or after a meal?).</p>
<p><strong>Learn About Medical Tests </strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, doctors need to do blood tests, x-rays, or other procedures to find out what is wrong or to learn more about your medical condition. Some tests, such as Pap tests, mammograms, glaucoma tests, and screenings for prostate and colorectal cancer, are done regularly to check for hidden medical problems.</p>
<p>Before having a medical test, ask your doctor to explain why it is important, what it will show, and what it will cost. Ask what kind of things you need to do to prepare for the test. For example, you may need to have an empty stomach, or you may have to provide a urine sample. Ask how you will be notified of the test results and how long they will take to come in.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask About Medical Tests </strong>
<ul>
<li>Why is the test being done?</li>
<li>What steps does the test involve? How should I get ready?</li>
<li>Are there any dangers or side effects?</li>
<li>How will I find out the results? How long will it take to get the results?</li>
<li>What will we know after the test?</li>
</ul>
<p>When the results are ready, make sure the doctor tells you what they are and explains what they mean. You may want to ask your doctor for a written copy of the test results. If the test is done by a specialist, ask to have the results sent to your primary doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss Your Diagnosis and What to Expect </strong></p>
<p>A diagnosis identifies your disease or physical problem. The doctor makes a diagnosis based on the symptoms you are experiencing and the results of the physical exam, laboratory work, and other tests.</p>
<p>If you understand your medical condition, you can help make better decisions about treatment. If you know what to expect, it may be easier for you to deal with the condition.</p>
<p>Ask the doctor to tell you the name of the condition and why he or she thinks you have it. Ask how it may affect you and how long it might last. Some medical problems never go away completely. They can&#8217;t be cured, but they can be treated or managed.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask About Your Diagnosis </strong>
<ul>
<li>What may have caused this condition? Will it be permanent?</li>
<li>How is this condition treated or managed? What will be the long-term effects on my life?</li>
<li>How can I learn more about my condition?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talk About Your Medications </strong></p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe a drug for your condition. Make sure you know the name of the drug and understand why it has been prescribed for you. Ask the doctor to write down how often and for how long you should take it.</p>
<p>Make notes about any other special instructions. If you are taking other medications, make sure your doctor knows what they are, so he or she can prevent harmful drug interactions. Check with your doctor&#8217;s office before taking any over-the-counter medications.</p>
<p>Let the doctor know if your medicine doesn&#8217;t seem to be working or if it is causing problems. If you want to stop taking your medicine, check with your doctor first.</p>
<p>You may find it helpful to keep a chart of all the medicines you take and when you take them. A sample chart is included in <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/tracking-your-medications-worksheet" target="_blank">Tracking Your Medications: Worksheet</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Four Tips to Help You Remember the Doctor&#8217;s Instructions </strong></p>
<p>No matter what your age, it&#8217;s easy to forget a lot of what your doctor says. Even if you are comfortable talking with your doctor, you may not always understand what he or she says. So, as your doctor gives you information, it&#8217;s a good idea to check that you are following along. Ask about anything that does not seem clear. For instance, you might say: &#8220;I want to make sure I understand. Could you explain that a little more?&#8221; or &#8220;I did not understand that word. What does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another way to check is to repeat what you think the doctor means in your own words and ask, &#8220;Is this correct?&#8221; Here are some other ideas to help make sure you have all the information you need.</p>
<p>▪Take notes. Take along a notepad and pen and write down the main points, or ask the doctor to write them down for you. If you can&#8217;t write while the doctor is talking to you, make notes in the waiting room after the visit. Or bring an audio recorder along and (with the doctor&#8217;s permission) record what is said. Recording is especially helpful if you want to share the details of the visit with others.</p>
<p>▪Get written or recorded materials. Ask if your doctor has any brochures, DVDs, or other materials about your health conditions or treatments. For example, if your doctor says that your blood pressure is high, he or she may give you brochures explaining what causes high blood pressure and what you can do about it. Ask the doctor to recommend other sources, such as websites, disease management centers, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies that may have written or recorded information you can use.</p>
<p>▪Talk to other members of the healthcare team. Sometimes, the doctor may want you to talk with other health professionals who can help you understand and carry out the decisions about how to manage your condition. Nurses, physician assistants, pharmacists, and occupational or physical therapists may be able to take more time with you than the doctor.</p>
<p>▪Call or email the doctor. If you are uncertain about the doctor&#8217;s instructions after you get home, call the office. A nurse or other staff member can check with the doctor and call you back. You could ask whether the doctor, or other health professional you have talked to, has an email address or online health portal you can use to send questions.</p>

			<h2>Top 5 Considerations for Retirees Purchasing Travel Insurance</h2>
			 
		 	<p>“While travel can be complicated at any age, retirees are faced with additional considerations, especially when it comes to medical coverage,” said Stan Sandberg, co-founder of TravelInsurance.com. “There are not only ways to save on your next travel insurance policy, but also things to keep in mind to ensure you are taken care of under unforeseen circumstances.”</p>
<p>Here are five things retirees should consider when purchasing travel insurance:</p>
<p><strong>Medicare doesn&#8217;t provide coverage outside the United States.</strong> Health care received outside the U.S. is generally not covered under standard Medicare plans. Travel insurance can provide emergency travel medical coverage with limits that can reach $250,000 per person or more. For extreme situations where an overseas hospital can’t handle the emergency, most travel insurance plans offer Emergency Evacuation coverage with limits up to $1.0 million per person. Retirees planning to travel overseas multiple times a year should consider purchasing Medicare supplement insurance or a Medigap plan. However, since Medigap plans can have deductibles, lifetime coverage limits up to $50,000, and limits on the length of trip, most retiree travelers may find single-trip travel insurance a better option.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase travel insurance early to qualify for a pre-existing condition waiver.</strong> Most travel insurance plans will exclude coverage for losses that stem from a pre-existing condition. However, many plans offer a Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion Waiver (meaning pre-existing conditions will be covered). To qualify, one must meet certain requirements, the most important being to purchase the travel insurance plan within a strict time window – usually 7-21 days – from when the initial payment was made. Also, travelers typically need to insure 100% of their pre-paid and non-refundable trip costs. For travelers with pre-existing conditions, this is one of the most important considerations in purchasing a plan, as prior injuries, illnesses, diseases or other types of medical conditions in which any treatment or care was sought in the 6-12 month period prior to the policy effective date all fall into this category. We highly recommend travelers speak to a licensed agent to see if they qualify for a Pre-Existing Condition Waiver or read full coverage details prior to buying.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re traveling with a group, you can save money with Group Travel Plans. </strong>Some Group Travel Plans do not factor in traveler ages when pricing the cost of travel insurance, which can make plans more affordable to older travelers. Typically, to qualify for this coverage, the group must include at least 10 individuals all traveling on the same itinerary on similar dates. Group plans are also designed for easy administration by a group leader who can manage sign-ups and changes on behalf of each individual.</p>
<p><strong>Trip Cancellation provides greater flexibility for those who need it.</strong> Unlike Medigap coverage, travel insurance can offer trip cancellation and interruption coverage. This coverage can cover the reimbursement of trip costs due to a range of unexpected circumstances, from last-minute illnesses to severe weather and natural disasters. For the most flexibility, travelers may consider purchasing a plan with a Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR) upgrade, which provides reimbursement for up to 75% of the total trip costs for a cancellation for any reason, as long as the cancellation occurs more than 48 hours prior to the trip departure date. This benefit is usually only available if the policy is purchased within 7-21 days of the initial trip payment and 100% of pre-paid and non-refundable trip costs are insured.</p>
<p><strong>You can buy travel insurance for your activities, too.</strong> Just because travelers are retired doesn’t mean they aren’t adventurous. For the active or adventure traveler, we recommend plans that offer Hazardous or Adventure Sports coverage, which provide coverage for higher risk activities, such as heli-skiing, off-trail snowboarding, bungee jumping, rock climbing or SCUBA diving below a certain depth. If travel entails any of those activities, travelers will need travel insurance plans that offers coverage for those specific activities.</p>

			<h2>A Simple Brochure May Help Combat the Opioid Epidemic</h2>
			 
		 	<p>A straightforward patient-education brochure that explains how to dispose of unused pain pills can help battle the nation’s opioid epidemic, researchers say. Unused prescription painkillers lying around the home have proven to be a major source of drugs supplying the epidemic.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, reported that adult patients who received the brochure were twice as likely to properly dispose of their opioids than those who did not receive the brochure.</p>
<p>The study results were published in January 2018 as an &#8220;article in press&#8221; on the website of the <em>Journal of the American College of Surgeons </em>ahead of print.</p>
<p>Investigators studied 334 patients who underwent operations at Washington University&#8217;s upper extremity/peripheral nerve clinic from February to September 2017, 170 who received the brochure and 164 who did not. Patients who received the brochure disposed of opioids at a rate of 22 percent vs. 11 percent among those who did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is strong data indicating that prescription opioid use is a risk for heroin use,&#8221; study coauthor Katherine B. Santosa, MD, said, citing a 2012 study that found that 86 percent of intravenous drug users reported having misused opioid pain relievers before using heroin. &#8220;Initiation of misuse occurred through three main sources: family, friends, or personal prescriptions.”</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control has reported that 33,091 drug overdose deaths in 2015 were attributed to opioid abuse, quadrupling since 1999. In 2016, drug overdose deaths overall rose to 64,070, a 21 percent increase over 2015.</p>
<p>Opioids are effective for treating pain after operations, but previous studies have shown that people who have surgery often get prescriptions for more pills than they need and end up keeping the medications in their homes instead of throwing them out. Too often surgical patients do not get instructions on how to dispose of unused pain pills. Jessica Hasak, MPH, and coauthors cited a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration finding that nearly 70 percent of people surveyed obtained their most recently used pain reliever or sedative divergently from a friend or family member.</p>
<p>A team consisting of attending surgeons, a clinical fellow, a nurse practitioner, a research nurse coordinator, and patient service and education administrators designed the educational brochure that describes drug disposal methods based on Food and Drug Administration guidelines and published medical reports. The brochure included key points about the opioid epidemic and the problem with unsafe disposal, step-by-step instructions for proper disposal in the trash, including discarding the empty bottle, and websites that provide lists of drug take-back locations.</p>
<p>Hasak explained that the self-disposal method the brochure described recommends mixing unused opioid medications with undesirable household substances such as coffee grounds, soil, kitty litter, or dish detergent in a plastic food storage bag and disposing the mixture in the trash.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were encouraged by our findings and have now designed and are testing an even more straightforward one-page brochure to see if disposal will be even more efficient,&#8221; Hasak said. The new brochure would encourage patients to mix unused opioid medications with liquid dish detergent in a plastic food storage bag. &#8220;Our thought was that the simpler and easier for the patient the instructions and disposal method can be, the more likely we as medical practitioners will be to empower them to do something about the problem.”</p>
<p>The Washington University researchers hope that their findings will encourage widespread use of a similar intervention in surgery clinics around the country. &#8220;Our big goal is to empower everyone to potentially save a life of a young person by getting a national campaign led from the ground up to clean these drugs out of medicine cabinets,&#8221; said coauthor Susan E. Mackinnon, MD, FACS. Added Santosa, &#8220;Considering that early exposure to opioid pain medications is a significant risk for future use of illegal substances, we must empower everyone, perhaps through a national campaign, to get these dangerous drugs out of American medicine cabinets.&#8221;</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Geriatric Emergency-Room Program Reduces Unnecessary Hospital Admissions</h2>
			 
		 	<p>An emergency-room program focused on geriatric patients has sharply reduced unnecessary hospital admissions of older adults, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers from Northwestern University, Mount Sinai Medical Center and St. Joseph&#8217;s Regional Medical Center, all in Chicago.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this program, we have created an otherwise non-existent safety net for this vulnerable population,&#8221; said Dr. Scott Dresden, co-author on the paper and assistant professor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. &#8220;We wanted to ensure that we weren&#8217;t just discharging older patients from the emergency department only to be hospitalized again relatively quickly after something preventable like a fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the study, nurses who were focused specifically on geriatric care determined if emergency department patients aged 65 and older were experiencing mental or physical decline, if they were having trouble caring for themselves at home and if they had medical complexities common in older adults.</p>
<p>Sometimes these patients would be moved out of the busy emergency department to a less active floor that had quieter rooms with doors, TVs and natural lighting that were more comfortable for older patients. The patients received follow-up calls after being discharged and were offered appointments with social workers, if necessary.</p>
<p>Patients visiting the emergency department who received specialized care were admitted to the hospital 36 percent of the time whereas patients who did not receive the specialized care were admitted 53 percent of the time.</p>
<p>The study was published in the <em>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</em>.</p>
<p>The research was the result of the Geriatric Emergency Department Innovations (GEDI) program introduced at the three hospitals in 2013. The goal of the program was to reduce the need to hospitalize older patients after an emergency department visit and to prevent revisits and readmissions.</p>
<p>The program has allowed all three institutions to learn more about this older population and how to address their needs without needing to admit them to the hospital, said Dresden, director of the GEDI department at Northwestern Medicine.</p>
<p>Northwestern&#8217;s program staffs one or two GEDI nurses, one pharmacist and a social worker every weekday between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. The nurses assess older patients who come into the emergency department to determine if they are candidates for the GEDI program. If a patient qualifies, he or she receives a one-on-one visit from the GEDI nurse to discuss everything from their medical state and if they&#8217;ve visited the emergency department in the last 30 days to their support system at home and how they get their groceries.</p>
<p>GEDI nurses ask a series of questions, such as &#8220;Who is the current president of the United States?&#8221; and &#8220;What was your mother&#8217;s maiden name?&#8221; to determine the patient&#8217;s cognitive state. As part of the program, patients will receive follow-up calls after being discharged from the emergency department and might receive counseling from a social worker. They will sometimes get transferred directly to a nursing home if the GEDI nurse determines it’s necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northwestern&#8217;s GEDI program has space outside the emergency department where GEDI patients sometimes get transferred. Rooms on this floor have non-glare, non-slip floors, doors instead of curtains, and TVs and windows, which the emergency room does not have. But Dresden said the most unique and beneficial part of the program is the dedicated GEDI team, not the physical space.</p>
<p>&#8220;This program is a model that other hospitals can easily adopt because they don&#8217;t have to build a separate space,&#8221; Dresden said.</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Housework Gender Differences May Affect Health in Elderly Men and Women</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Elderly men across Europe and the US spend less time on housework than elderly women do, according to a study published in January 2018 in the open access journal <em>BMC Public Health</em>. Researchers at the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology found that elderly women on average spent almost five hours a day doing housework compared to only around three hours a day for elderly men. The study also found that while those who did more housework felt healthier, women who did long hours of housework combined with too much or too little sleep reported poorer health.</p>
<p>A release from BioMed Central quotes corresponding author Nicholas Adje, Doctoral Researcher in Public Health, as saying, &#8220;Engaging in a few hours of housework may be beneficial to the health of older adults. However, we were surprised to see significant gender differences when looking at the combination of time spent on housework activities and time spent sleeping. Long periods of housework combined with too much or too little sleep &#8211; that is fewer than seven or more than eight hours of sleep, respectively &#8211; was associated with poor health among elderly women, whereas in men the same was associated with good health.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study found notable differences between the type of housework men and women spent time on. Across all countries included in this study, men spent less time cleaning, cooking and shopping than women (88.7 minutes a day compared to 217.9 minutes a day). However, women were found to spend less time on gardening and maintenance tasks than men (38.5 minutes a day compared to 68.8 minutes a day).</p>
<p>The researchers found that elderly women in Italy and Germany spent the most time on housework (around five hours a day), while women in the US spent the least amount of time doing housework (four hours a day). In contrast, elderly men in Italy spent the least amount of time on housework (2.7 hours a day) and German men spent the most time on housework (4.2 hours a day).</p>
<p>To examine the associations between time spent on housework, time spent sleeping and health, the study used self-reported data from 15,333 men and 20,907 women aged 65 years and over from Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, France, the Netherlands and the US. Participants reported the total time they spent per day on 41 activities in 5, 10 or 15-minute intervals. They also reported the total amount of time they spent sleeping per day, as well as whether they felt they were in poor, fair, good or very good health. Nicholas Adjei said: &#8220;The percentage of those aged 65 years and above is increasing globally due to higher life expectancy. It is important to understand how older adults spend their time in these later years and the possible positive and negative implications for their health.&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors caution that the cross-sectional, observational nature of the study does not allow for conclusions about cause and effect. While the study relied on self-reported data, previous research has demonstrated reliability and accuracy of this kind of data in reflecting current health status, according to the authors.</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>Scar Wars: Winning the Battle Against Keloids</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Time may heal the wound, but – for some of us – the scar that is left behind will not fade. When it comes to keloid scars, the opposite happens. These scars expand beyond the initial wound site. Their appearance can be a big problem, and they also can cause, pain, discomfort and limit movement.</p>
<p>In normal cases, our body creates a scar to heal from a wound. But in the case of keloid scars, our body fails to turn off its cellular skin-repair processes. As a result, there is an overgrowth: shiny pink skin-colored or purple flesh that bubbles up, above and beyond the wound’s boundary. We’re still learning about the biological misfire that causes this uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>In general, about ten percent of us are keloid prone, but those with darker skin are more susceptible, with as many as fifteen percent developing keloids. Genetics plays a role: Fifty percent of sufferers share the condition with other family members. Age is also a factor, with most patients developing the scars during their teens and 20s, often when they are actively growing. Pregnant women and athletes also seem to be more susceptible to this malady.</p>
<p>Keloids can be triggered by minimal skin damage: an injection, a piercing, a tattoo. The scar overgrowth may take place long after the initial wound has healed and may continue to grow over a period of time. They generally do not resolve on their own.</p>
<p>Keloids themselves are benign. But their appearance can be distressing and deforming. Also, they may be itchy, painful, and sensitive. And depending on their size and location, they may inhibit movement.</p>
<p>Because these scars are prone to reoccur if cut out,“keloids present a complex dermatologic challenge. We need to help patients navigate the maze of treatment options so they feel empowered to make effective choices.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I share the following tips:</p>
<p><strong>6 Recommendations Regarding Keloid Scars</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong> Remain aware of how keloids form: </strong>Most keloid scars are triggered by some kind of skin damage. This is really important in terms of understanding treatment plans – and also regarding other life choices, like decisions about whether to get a piercing or a tattoo, for a person prone to this problem.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Take time to consider options: </strong>There are a range of treatments including lasers, steroidal and chemical injections, freezing procedures, and radiation techniques. It’s vital for patients to work with their doctors to understand which will be most effective for their own situation. Whether the scar is early- or late-stage, its size and location are all factors in customizing the most effective treatment plan. The treatment therapy also depends if they just want to eliminate the pain and itching, or if they want to completely remove the appearance of the keloid.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Understand the role of combination treatments: </strong>A combination of treatments can minimize the existing scar and also limit subsequent regrowth. Steroidal injections, for example, are often combined with cryotherapy, which applies freezing temperatures to minimize the scar. We may also add a cocktail to the injections including various types of steroids, anesthetics, and immunosuppressants to improve the results. And if surgery is warranted, additional treatment to prevent regrowth is required. The great effectiveness of pairing surgical removal with superficial radiation therapy.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Stay alert for treatment advances, such as </strong><strong><u>Cryoshape</u></strong><strong>™: </strong>“The ‘Cryoshape™’ procedure involves freezing a keloid scar from the inside. This causes the scar tissue to die and eventually fall off. Also – importantly – the internal freezing appears to destroy abnormal keloid cells and inhibit regrowth. We’re seeing really good results.” There are also new topical treatments many of which include silicone in either a liquid or patch form. Pressure and massage may also have a role in treatment.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Choose your doctor carefully:</strong> If not treated properly, patients can end up with additional scarring or with a series of frustrating outcomes. Also, since research is ongoing and new treatments are emerging, it’s important that your doctor is on top of the most current techniques.”</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Take preventative steps to avoid additional scars:</strong> Keloid-prone patients should avoid unnecessary skin damage, like piercings and tattoos If surgery is needed, patients should work with their doctor on a post-op plan to minimize scarring. In the case of skin injuries, the American Academy of Dermatology web site includes a list of self-care steps that can limit keloids.</li>
</ol>
<p>The good news is our growing understanding of keloids is giving us improved techniques to help patients.</p>

			<h2>Pre-Retirees and Retirees Can Beat Inflation and Reduce Risk by Splitting Savings</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Financial planners agree that pre-retirees and retirees need investment growth to beat inflation.</p>
<p>But while equities have outperformed fixed options in the long run, markets can plummet and take many years to recover. Retirees who have too much money tied up in the stock market take a big risk. If you need income and have to take withdrawals when the market is down, you may deplete your savings prematurely.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, putting all your money in safe Treasuries and CDs presents a different risk. With their low yields, they may not offer a sufficient bulwark against inflation.</p>
<p>So how can you structure your savings to grow faster than the rate of inflation? How can you obtain safety, yield and growth potential?</p>
<p>Divide your retirement portfolio into three buckets: <em>growth, safety, </em>and<em> safety plus growth potential. </em>By splitting up your savings wisely among these three slices, you’ll have the best shot at beating inflation without taking excessive risk.</p>
<p><strong>Safe vehicles</strong> include certificates of deposit, bank accounts, Treasuries, municipal bonds, and fixed-rate annuities. Safe investments, except annuities and municipal bonds, increase your taxable income unless they’re in a qualified retirement account.</p>
<p>Among safe-bucket choices, only fixed-rate deferred annuities are tax-deferred. Without the drag of annual taxes on your interest earnings, your savings will grow faster until you need the money.</p>
<p>Tax deferral is a key tool to beat inflation. Max out your contributions to your IRA or 401(k) or similar plan, and then shelter from taxation even more of your retirement savings in annuities.</p>
<p>Like CDs, fixed annuities pay a fixed rate of interest for a set period of time that you choose. But they usually pay considerably more than CDs with the same term. For instance, the highest-paying five-year CD was recently yielding 2.45 percent versus 3.30 percent for a five-year annuity.</p>
<p>That extra 0.85 percentage point of yield means that that the annuity is paying 34.7 percent more than the CD. Combining a markedly higher yield with tax deferral makes for a big long-term advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong> <strong>plus growth potential</strong>. The fixed index annuity is the only vehicle in this category.</p>
<p>This is the only asset I know of that both guarantees your principal and gives you market-based upside potential. It can hedge against inflation without adding downside risk.</p>
<p>Your principal is guaranteed, but the interest rate varies according to the performance of an underlying market index. The product is suited for people who want principal protection but are willing to withstand some interest-rate uncertainty.</p>
<p>You get an opportunity to earn more interest than with other safe investments. You can shelter some of your money from market risk without locking in a lower fixed interest rate.</p>
<p>The fixed index annuity credits interest based on the changes to a market index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&amp;P 500. Interest is credited when the index value increases, but when it falls, you lose nothing. Since the minimum interest rate is usually zero, there may be years when you earn no interest.</p>
<p>In exchange for downside market protection, you’ll usually receive less than 100 percent of the index’s gains. How much you’ll get depends on the limiting factor(s) used.</p>
<p>A cap rate sets the maximum rate of interest. A participation rate determines what percentage of the increase in the underlying market index will be used to calculate the index-linked interest credits during the index term. A spread rate or margin is a percentage that’s deducted from the change in the underlying index value to determine the net amount of index-linked interest credited to the annuity.</p>
<p>Fixed index annuities are suited for investors with a longer time horizon of seven or more years.</p>
<p>People who can meet their liquidity needs from other accounts are good candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Growth investments,</strong> primarily U.S. and foreign stocks, are generally considered the best long-term inflation hedge but have unpredictable returns over the short and medium term. Retirement savers should decide how much risk they can withstand today while gradually reducing their equity portion as they age.</p>
<p>How much should you allocate to these three buckets? One question to ask is: How much of my funds am I willing to wait to regrow in case of a market decline before I want or need to access them?</p>
<p>Also, consider your need for cash and/or income.</p>
<p>If you need to withdraw interest earnings annually, I’d recommend plain fixed-rate investments for that portion of your assets. Beyond that, the right mix of growth, safety, and safety-plus-growth-potential investments is determined by your risk tolerance.</p>

			<h2>Are Couples Who Choose to Live Apart Tested When Partners Require Caregiving?</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Previous research has shown that unmarried adults are choosing long-distance or cross-residential relationships as a way to have companionship and independence later in life. Jacquelyn Benson, an expert of older adult relationships from the University of Missouri, has found that such couples safeguard personal autonomy to maintain partnerships and relationship satisfaction. While autonomy is paramount for these couples, participants in the study also emphasized the importance of having a flexible mindset about their relationships, especially when one partner needs additional care.</p>
<p>A release from the university explains that “Living Apart Together,” or LAT partnerships is a growing phenomenon among older adults. The term refers to an intimate, committed relationship that exists between two partners without a shared residence. While the trend is well understood in Europe, it remains lesser known in the U.S. This means that certain family issues that become important in later life, like caregiving or medical decision-making, could be difficult to navigate for LAT couples and their relatives.</p>
<p>The release quotes Benson as saying, “The societal standard for elder caregiving in the United States is to expect spouses and adult children to step in as primary caregivers; however, we do not know how these expectations apply in LAT arrangements. In our research we are learning that, while living apart seems to be almost universally viewed as a necessity for maintaining relationship satisfaction for these couples, paradoxically couples also are willing to make changes in living arrangements to provide caregiving support to one another.”</p>
<p>Benson interviewed adults who were at least 60 years old and in committed relationships but did not live together. She found that for most of these couples, living apart and being independent was considered ideal.  Participants in the study recognized that keeping separate homes was the simplest strategy for safeguarding their autonomy.</p>
<p>Benson cautioned against making any conclusions about actual caregiving behaviors. “Most of the individuals we interviewed had not been tested by the realities of caregiving within their current LAT partnerships. It will be important to follow LAT partners over time to see if their willingness transforms into action and understand the mechanisms that explain these care provision decisions,” she said.</p>
<p>Benson acknowledges that further research is needed to better understand repartnering in later life. She is seeking older adults from around the country in committed, monogamous relationships who are choosing to live apart (in a LAT relationship) or living together and unmarried (cohabiting).

			<h2>When Everything&#8217;s Great&#8230;Except The Sex</h2>
			 
		 	<p>So you’re back on the dating circuit. Maybe you were married before, or in a long relationship. Maybe you’ve been single and without a sexual partner for a while. Now you’re dating, and you’ve found someone you like a lot.</p>
<p>You’re both morning people who share a taste for screwball comedy. You agree deep dish pizza is preferable to thin crust. Even better, you know you’re both dog (not cat) people.</p>
<p>Then you find out there’s a problem between the sheets. He’s just not good in bed.</p>
<p>Is there hope for this relationship moving forward, or should you call it quits?</p>
<p>Sexual incompatibility is an enormous issue that can signal an end to what seemed like the perfect budding relationship. But while certain obviously glaring issues can be deal breakers, the vast majority of physical-intimacy issues between consenting adults can be resolved by communication and a willingness to leave one’s comfort zone.</p>
<p>Some points to take into consideration:</p>
<p>Is it just you who feels this way or is it both of you? The female libido has been known to take a nosedive at the onset of menopause. It’s possible that no matter how attentive your new partner is, your body just takes longer to respond. If you’re not having an orgasm despite foreplay and vigorous intercourse, have a chat with your gynecologist before blaming your partner. A common first step to remedying the situation is to have your hormone levels checked. Your doctor may recommend an estrogen treatment that will help you achieve satisfaction.</p>
<p>Are you open to learning each other’s sexual likes and dislikes? Your new partner isn’t a mind reader; unless you tell him where you prefer to be touched and how, he’s bound to make mistakes. Is there a position you favor, or do you always tense up when your tummy’s touched? Convey this information to your new partner. As long as you share your preferences in a friendly way, most likely he’ll appreciate the advice. If he doesn’t, that should send up a red flag.</p>
<p>Is it just awkward? Elbows in the wrong place or can’t find a comfortable position? Sex, even between two people who are youthful and acrobatic, can be physically awkward. The best solution is to keep trying and to speak up. Most important, be willing to laugh at the ludicrous parts. Sex can be comical, and often a good laugh is more bonding to you as a couple than having a simultaneous orgasm.</p>
<p>Are you focusing on the person or your expectations? When we’re very attracted to a new person, we project what it’s going to be like in bed. Upright and fully clothed, this person is irresistible; naked and lying down, they might seem entirely different. You may have spent hours fantasizing about your new partner and the great sex you’re going to have only to discover he’s just a regular guy who finishes in a few minutes and then turns over and goes to sleep. Measure your disappointment against your expectations before you show him the door.</p>
<p>Basically, though, most guys want to make their partners happy. If you’re thinking there’s a chance you might be in this for the long haul, invest the time to get to know each other – sexually and otherwise.</p>

			<h2>Can a To-Do List Help You Sleep Better?</h2>
			 
		 	<p>If you have trouble falling asleep, you might try writing a brief to-do list, researchers say.</p>
<p>Investigators from Baylor University compared sleep patterns between study participants who took five minutes to write down upcoming duties versus participants who listed completed activities, and found that the do-to list won the battle for sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,&#8221; said lead author Michael K. Scullin, Ph.D., director of Baylor&#8217;s Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory and assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience. &#8220;Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study of 57 university students, conducted in the Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory, was published in the American Psychological Association&#8217;s <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two schools of thought about this,&#8221; Scullin said. &#8220;One is that writing about the future would lead to increased worry about unfinished tasks and delay sleep, while journaling about completed activities should not trigger worry. The alternative hypothesis is that writing a to-do list will &#8216;offload&#8217; those thoughts and reduce worry.”</p>
<p>While anecdotal evidence exists that writing a bedtime list can help one fall asleep, the Baylor study used overnight polysomnography, the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of sleep measurement, Scullin said. With that method, researchers monitor electrical brain activity using electrodes.</p>
<p>Participants stayed in the lab on a week night to avoid weekend effects on bedtime and because on a weekday night, they probably had unfinished tasks to do the next day, Scullin said. They were divided into two randomly selected groups and given five-minute writing assignments before retiring. One group was asked to write down everything they needed to remember to do the next day or over the next few days; the other to write about tasks completed during the previous few days.</p>
<p>Students went to bed at 10:30 p.m., and &#8220;we had them in a controlled environment,&#8221; Scullin said. &#8220;We absolutely restricted any technology, homework, etc. It was simply lights out after they got into bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scullin noted that while the sample size was appropriate for an experimental, laboratory-based polysomnography study, a larger future study would be of value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Measures of personality, anxiety and depression might moderate the effects of writing on falling asleep, and that could be explored in an investigation with a larger sample,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We recruited healthy young adults, and so we don&#8217;t know whether our findings would generalize to patients with insomnia, though some writing activities have previously been suggested to benefit such patients.&#8221;</p>
		
		   		
			<h2>It&#8217;s Not Too Late to Get Your Flu Shot</h2>
			 
		 	<p><em>Editor’s note: News about the current flu season isn’t encouraging: It’s common in every state except Hawaii. But even in mid-January 2018, it’s not too late to protect yourself. Experts from the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) share why the vaccine is so important:</em></p>
<p>Haven’t had your flu shot yet? It’s not too late. And there are still good reasons to get one.</p>
<p>Flu — more formally known as influenza — is a serious viral disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Although every flu season is different, flu has resulted in anywhere from 9.2 million to 35.6 million illnesses; 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations; and 12,000 to 56,000 deaths every year since 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Flu viruses are spread through tiny droplets by people infected with flu who cough, sneeze, or talk. Flu also is spread by touching a surface or object that has flu viruses on it. Although influenza viruses circulate year-round, flu activity peaks between December and February most years, but activity can last as late as May in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>A Flu Vaccine Can Help</strong></p>
<p>An annual seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to reduce your risk of getting sick and spreading it to others. The vaccine typically is redesigned each year to contain flu virus strains expected to be prevalent during the upcoming flu season. The strains have been inactivated so that they don’t cause you to get sick with flu, but will trigger your immune system to produce antibodies that can protect against influenza disease.</p>
<p>When more people get vaccinated, less flu can spread through a community. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body.</p>
<p>The FDA plays a key role in ensuring that safe and effective vaccines are available every flu season. In fact, the task of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it’s a year-round initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need New Flu Vaccines Every Year</strong></p>
<p>According to the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review, there are several reasons new flu vaccines must be made each year.</p>
<p>Flu viruses can change from year to year because of different subtypes and strains that circulate each year. A vaccine is needed that includes virus strains that most closely match those in circulation, and the protection provided by the previous year’s vaccine will diminish over time.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s Most at Risk of Getting the Flu</strong></p>
<p>Typically, children and older people are most at risk for influenza, but occasionally a flu virus will circulate that disproportionately affects young and middle-age adults.</p>
<p>Influenza seasons and severity are unpredictable. Annual vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza among people ages six months and older. You also can reduce the spread of the flu and reduce its effects by taking such practical measures as washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when you’re sick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although antiviral drugs are not a substitute for vaccines, they can help to treat influenza. There are several FDA-approved antiviral drug products recommended by CDC for use against recently circulating influenza viruses.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Flu Virus Strains</strong></p>
<p>Each February, before that year’s flu season ends, the FDA, the World Health Organization, the CDC, and other public health experts collaborate on collecting and reviewing data from around the world to identify the flu viruses likely to cause the most illnesses during the next flu season. Based on that information and the recommendations of an FDA advisory committee, the agency selects the virus strains for FDA-licensed manufacturers to include in their vaccines for use in the United States.</p>
<p>The closer the match between the virus strains chosen for the vaccine and what strains are circulating causing disease during the next flu season, the better the protection that the flu vaccines can provide.</p>
<p>To ensure that vaccines are safe, effective, and of high quality, the FDA prepares and provides reagents (materials to standardize vaccines) that vaccine manufacturers need to make their vaccine and to verify its identity and strength. The FDA also inspects the manufacturing facilities regularly and evaluates each manufacturer’s vaccine annually for approval purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Flu Vaccines Are Safe</strong></p>
<p>The FDA’s oversight doesn’t end there. After manufacturers have distributed their vaccines for use by the public, the FDA, working with CDC scientists, routinely evaluates reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of health problems that may be associated with a vaccine. And the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conduct annual surveillance for Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological condition associated with the 1976 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Other avenues exist to monitor vaccine safety. The FDA conducts influenza and other vaccine surveillance within the Sentinel Post Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) system.</p>
<p>And the CDC maintains the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which provides nearly real-time monitoring of people who are vaccinated, in collaboration with nine integrated health care organizations.</p>

			<h2>4 Ways Parents, Teachers and Students Can Reduce Standardized-Test Stress</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Standardized testing has drawn its share of criticism from teachers, students and parents. One of the most common complaints is the stress that all three groups feel – from preparation through performance.</p>
<p>From a young age, students take these timed tests that measure academic competency and, ultimately, whether they’re college material. Countless articles on standardized testing in the U.S. point out the pressure on students to score well; that teachers are often evaluated by how their students fare on the tests; and that parents get anxiety hoping their children score high.</p>
<p>Amid all this stress comes the basic but difficult-to-answer question: How to deal with it?</p>
<p>There is a tremendous amount of controversy about standardized testing, and no matter which side of the argument you are on, teachers have no choice. So teachers, students and parents must deal with it the best way they can. And finding consistently healthy habits to counter these stress inducers is so important. In fact, taking the stress out of the test process can carry over to every aspect of their life. The scores aren’t as important as the quality of life they give themselves in what is a results-oriented world, often to a fault.</p>
<p>Here are four tips that teachers, students and parents can use to better deal with test-related stress:
<ul>
<li><strong>Diet.</strong> Poor eating habits contribute to stress. Good wholesome foods that are not processed or refined and are free from trans fats prevent our energy levels from peaking and crashing throughout the day.</li>
<li><strong>Rest.</strong> Getting enough sleep helps keep your body and mind in top shape, making you better equipped to deal with any negative stressors. Most of your healing and repair takes place when you are sleeping. This is when the body recharges the battery. If you continue to deprive your body of sleep, your immune system breaks down and you get sick.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise. </strong>A study conducted by California State University found that a 10-minute walk is enough to increase energy, alter mood, and provide a positive outlook for up to two hours. Exercise also assists in quality sleep. Exercise is the greatest stress buster. Regular exercise can change your life.”</li>
<li><strong>Mental attitude.</strong> Stress is like a snowball: If you let it roll, it will gain speed, momentum and weight, and you are over-reacting, making even small difficulties seem like major crises. I suggest countering a stressful situation with a calming action. Example: when rush-hour traffic is irritating, listen to a self-improvement audio. Some things we can’t control, but we can control our response to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stress can cause all sorts of health problems. It affects all ages, as seen with the implementation of standardized testing. But it can be dealt with on a daily basis, and by doing so consistently, it can help us pass any and all stress tests in the future.</p>

			<h2>7 Resolutions to Drop Before January 31st</h2>
			 
		 	<p>Put down those free weights and drop the kale smoothie! Your New Year’s resolution might be sabotaging your life.</p>
<p>U.S. News reports that an astonishing <em>80%</em> of Americans ditch their resolutions by February of any given new year. A failed resolution, especially so early in the year, can be a disheartening and expensive waste of time, smudging what was supposed to be a clean slate. But the inability to keep a resolution doesn’t have to reflect poorly on the resolution-maker herself. It might just mean that the goal she set wasn’t right to begin with.</p>
<p>If this sounds like you—<em>don’t worry.</em> With the <a href="http://thirdage.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-super-blue-blood-moon-around-the-corner/">Blue Moon lunar eclipse</a> on January 31<sup>st</sup>, there is another opportunity to start fresh in 2018. But first, out with the old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/6eb064ac96de04601f4b18fda/images/c0c9ace7-e306-4cb3-b09a-15d9ed7c8679.png" alt="" width="730" height="430" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>No Dining Out</strong>.</span><br />
Staying in can help save your wallet and waistline, but regularly eating with others actually has emotional, spiritual, and social benefits—there is a reason why so many cultures have centuries-old rituals of communal eating. If you are hoping to save money, try a modified resolution of hosting a friends’ potluck dinner once every other month. If a healthy body is your goal, aim to try one new healthy food a week to experiment with when dining out, and keep things, well, fresh!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Go to the Gym Every Day</strong>. <strong>Or Plan to Run Several Miles Every Day</strong>.</span><br />
Even though gym and exercise resolutions are often well-intentioned, they set resolution-makers up for failure by not leaving room for rest and recovery; critical parts of any fitness routine. Instead of resolving to visit the gym <em>every </em>day, try adding only one more day to your current gym routine. If that means that you go once a week, that is perfectly fine. It may take longer to notice changes in your body, but your body <em>and </em>your mind will thank you down the road. Building habits slowly is the really the only way to do it. Science says the absolute minimum time threshold for forming a habit as simple as drinking water with lunch is 21 days…and the average is close to two whole months!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Read a Book a Week</strong>. <strong>Or Finish Every Magazine You Read – Cover to Cover</strong>.</span><br />
Even if your reading list is fifty books long, this is a perfect example of an overreaching resolution. With life’s many uncertainties, it very well might take you longer than seven days to get to the end of that page turner. Instead of a book a week, aim for reading one book a month. If you end up reading more, celebrate success!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Start Downhill Skiing. Or Flying Trapeze</strong>.</span><br />
Taking on new hobbies is a<em> great</em> way to keep your mind and body young. However, take your limits into consideration when you choose <em>which </em> If you live in the desert or are prone to knee injuries, maybe downhill skiing isn’t the best option for a regular practice. Instead, resolve to try downhill skiing, or another hobby, one or two times in the new year. This will give you time to truly decide if it is the activity for you. More importantly, this will allow for self-forgiveness if you choose to stop.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Change Your Wardrobe&#8230;Completely</strong>.</span><br />
While wearing new clothes can be a fun way to expand your horizons, it’s important to not let go of the clothes that make you feel comfortable, powerful, or happy. You don’t have to do a complete overhaul to feel like a whole new you. If you’re aiming to switch up your look, try resolving to add four or five new,<em> different</em> pieces before overhauling your whole closet. This way, you can <em>amplify</em> your <em>je ne sais quoi</em> with your sartorial choices—not hide it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Go on a Diet</strong>. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Or Basically Decide to Eat Celery for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.</span><br />
</strong>Diets, much like New Year’s resolution rates, have a <em>remarkably</em> high drop-out rate. <em>Over 80% of people who lose weight on diets eventually gain it back</em>, and much of this is due to restrictive eating habits that deprive the body of essential nutrients. Instead of aiming to eat <em>less</em> food, aim to eat more <em>good</em> Want a great tip? Aim to cook <em>all</em> of your meals for <em>30 days</em> with <a href="https://whole30.com/" target="_blank">Whole30</a> ingredients, a set of unprocessed, nutrient-rich foods –a great example of a food-related resolution that celebrates your body for eating rather than punishing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol start="7">
<li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Stop Drinking</strong>. <strong>As in Totally Stop Drinking. Forever.</strong> </span><br />
Just as overly restrictive diets can hamper your health goals, overly restricting rules like cutting out <em>all</em> alcohol can make it hard for you to succeed in the long run. While it can be great to take periodic breaks, rather than focusing on saying “no,” turn your attention to focus on saying “yes” to healthier options, such as cocktails made with fresh fruit juice, or <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/impressive-before-dinner-cocktails-759890" target="_blank">lighter aperitif cocktails</a> designed to prepare your stomach and palate for a meal. Of course, if this resolution is rooted in having a problematic relationship with alcohol, please seek help.</li>
